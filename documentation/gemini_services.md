## farzad ai functions. 


Here's how we can approach this and how it would work with your serverless proxy:
Core Idea:
For both "Webcam" and "Share Screen," the most practical approach with your current setup (and for a serverless proxy) is to:
Capture a still frame (an image) from the webcam feed or the shared screen.
Allow the user to type a text prompt associated with that captured frame.
Send both the image data (as a base64 string) and the text prompt to your /api/gemini-proxy.
The proxy will then send these to the Gemini API using the generateContent method with multiple parts (one image part, one text part).
Gemini processes the multimodal input and returns a text response.
This avoids the complexities of live video streaming to the AI through a serverless proxy, which is much harder to implement reliably.
Implementation Steps:
UI Updates (InteractionInputBar.tsx):
Add new "Webcam" and "Share Screen" buttons below the main text input area, similar to the layout in your reference image.
These buttons will toggle their respective modes.
Webcam Functionality:
When "Webcam" mode is activated:
Request camera permission using navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true }).
Display the live webcam feed in a small preview area within the UnifiedInteractionPanel (we'll add a placeholder for this).
Provide a button to "Capture Frame & Send."
When clicked, capture a frame from the video stream (e.g., draw to canvas, then toDataURL()), combine it with the current text in the input bar, and send it.
Screen Sharing Functionality:
When "Share Screen" mode is activated:
Request screen capture permission using navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({ video: true }).
(Optional) Display the shared screen in a preview (often not needed as the user sees their own screen).
Provide a button to "Capture Screen & Send."
When clicked, capture a frame, combine with text, and send.
State Management (UnifiedInteractionPanel.tsx):
Manage new states like isWebcamActive, isScreenShareActive, webcamStream, screenStream, capturedFrameData.
Service Layer (geminiService.ts):
The existing generateContentWithImageAndText function can be reused. The frontend will simply provide the base64 image data from the webcam/screen frame instead of a file upload.
Proxy (api/gemini-proxy.ts):
No significant changes needed here, as the generateContentWithImageAndText action in your proxy already handles multimodal input (image + text).
Permissions (metadata.json):
We'll need to add "camera" permission. Screen sharing permission is typically requested by the browser on-the-fly when getDisplayMedia() is called and doesn't need to be pre-declared in metadata.json.
Let's add the UI elements and the basic logic for these features.
The following changes will:
Add "Webcam" and "Share Screen" buttons.
Add placeholder logic for starting/stopping these streams and capturing frames.
Integrate the "send" flow with the existing onSendMessage prop.
Add camera permission to metadata.json.

This is a substantial update! Here's a summary of what's been done and what you'll need to do for full functionality:
Key Changes Implemented (Frontend Only):
metadata.json:
Added "camera" to requestFramePermissions.
components/interaction/InteractionInputBar.tsx:
New Buttons: "Webcam" and "Share Screen" buttons are added below the standard mode buttons (Text, Image Gen, Search). These are only visible when neither voice nor another multimodal stream is active.
MultiModalStreamType: A new type ('webcam' | 'screen' | null) is defined and used.
State & Props:
currentMultiModalStreamType: Tracks if webcam or screen share is active.
onToggleMultiModalStream: A new prop function to call when these buttons are clicked (to be implemented in UnifiedInteractionPanel).
onCaptureAndSendFrame: A new prop function to call to capture and send the frame.
UI Logic:
The main input bar's appearance changes (border color, pulse animation) when webcam/screen mode is active, similar to voice mode.
Placeholder text in the textarea updates based on the active mode (e.g., "Add a prompt for the webcam frame...").
The main action button (rightmost) changes to a "Camera" icon and "Capture & Send" text when a multimodal stream is active.
Text input is still allowed for providing a prompt with the webcam/screen frame.
The standard "Text", "Image Gen", "Search" mode buttons are hidden when webcam/screen is active.
The "Talk" button functionality is slightly adjusted to only activate voice if no other modes (text input, image gen mode, etc.) are explicitly engaged.
components/interaction/UnifiedInteractionPanel.tsx:
State Management:
currentMultiModalStreamType: Manages which stream (webcam, screen) is active.
activeStream: Holds the MediaStream object from getUserMedia or getDisplayMedia.
isCapturingFrame: A flag to prevent multiple capture attempts simultaneously.
Stream Handling Functions:
stopCurrentStream(): Stops any active webcam/screen stream and cleans up.
handleToggleMultiModalStream(type):
Requests permission for webcam (getUserMedia) or screen (getDisplayMedia).
Sets the activeStream and currentMultiModalStreamType.
For webcam, it attempts to set the srcObject of a new <video> element for preview.
For screen sharing, it listens to the 'ended' event on the track so it can clean up if the user stops sharing via browser UI.
handleCaptureAndSendFrame():
Uses ImageCapture API to take a photo (frame) from the activeStream.
Converts the frame (Blob) to a base64 string.
Calls onSendMessage with the current text from the input bar (you'll need to ensure this text is accessible or passed correctly) and the captured frame data.
Webcam Preview:
A <div> and <video ref={videoPreviewRef}> element are added to display the live webcam feed when currentMultiModalStreamType is 'webcam'.
Cleanup: Ensures streams are stopped when the panel is closed or when switching modes.
Props to Input Bar: Passes currentMultiModalStreamType, onToggleMultiModalStream, and onCaptureAndSendFrame down to InteractionInputBar.
How it conceptually works:
User clicks "Webcam" or "Share Screen" in the InteractionInputBar.
UnifiedInteractionPanel calls handleToggleMultiModalStream.
Browser permission is requested. If granted, the stream starts.
Webcam: Preview appears.
Screen Share: Browser UI indicates sharing.
The input bar now shows "Capture & Send" as the primary action. The user can type a text prompt to accompany the visual input.
User clicks "Capture & Send."
UnifiedInteractionPanel calls handleCaptureAndSendFrame.
A frame is captured, converted to base64.
onSendMessage is called with the text prompt and the image data.
This goes to App.tsx, then geminiService.ts, then your /api/gemini-proxy, which sends it to Gemini as a multimodal request.
Next Steps for You (Backend & Full Integration):
Proxy (api/gemini-proxy.ts):
Your current generateContentWithImageAndText action in the proxy should already be capable of handling this. Ensure it correctly constructs the contents array with one text part and one image part.
The geminiService.ts function generateContentWithImageAndText is also ready.
Error Handling & User Feedback:
Add more robust error handling (e.g., if getUserMedia fails, if ImageCapture fails).
Provide clearer visual feedback to the user about the state (e.g., "Starting webcam...", "Capturing frame...").
Prompt Management for Frames:
Currently, handleCaptureAndSendFrame tries to get the prompt text from document.querySelector('textarea[aria-label="Chat message input"]')?.value. This is a direct DOM access. For better React practice, you'd lift the typedMessage state from InteractionInputBar up to UnifiedInteractionPanel or pass a ref to get its value when capturing. For now, it's a simpler approach.
This gives you a solid frontend foundation for these exciting new features! Remember to test browser permissions thoroughly.

The ModelCapabilitiesSection.tsx file already accurately reflects the list of capabilities and their experimental status as shown in the image you provided. So, no changes are needed for that component to match the image.
Now, addressing your question: "how would I set up to work with all these functions in the Google Gemini, will all of this work in the backend with the Serverless Function (api/gemini-proxy.ts)?"
Yes, most of these capabilities can be enabled by making calls from your backend proxy (api/gemini-proxy.ts) to the Google Gemini API. The key is that your proxy will format the requests correctly based on what the client-side requests, and then securely add your API key.
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how each capability generally maps to Gemini API features and how your proxy could handle them:
Text Generation:
Gemini API: Standard generateContent call.
Proxy: Receives text prompt from client, calls ai.models.generateContent().
Feasibility: High. This is the most basic function.
Image Generation:
Gemini API: generateImages call (using a model like imagen-3.0-generate-002).
Proxy: Receives text prompt for image, calls ai.models.generateImages().
Feasibility: High.
Video Generation:
Gemini API: General text-to-video generation is typically handled by specialized models (e.g., Google's Veo). The standard Gemini models (like Flash/Pro) focus more on understanding video input rather than generating complex video from text.
Proxy: If "Video generation" means generating from text, your proxy would likely need to call a different, specialized API for this, not just the general Gemini API you're using for chat. If it refers to processing/analyzing video provided by the user, that's video understanding (see below).
Feasibility: Low with current general Gemini models for generation from text. High if it's about routing to a specialized video generation API.
Speech Generation (Text-to-Speech):
Gemini API: The gemini-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-dialog model (used by GdmLiveAudio) inherently includes speech synthesis. For standalone TTS from text, you might use Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API or see if a specific Gemini model configuration supports audio output for a given text input.
Proxy: Could call a dedicated TTS API or configure a Gemini call if supported.
Feasibility: Medium to High, depending on whether you use a dedicated TTS service or a specific Gemini model feature.
Music Generation:
Gemini API: Similar to video generation, this is a specialized task usually handled by dedicated models (e.g., Google's Lyria). General Gemini models don't typically generate full musical pieces.
Proxy: Would need to integrate with a specialized music generation API.
Feasibility: Low with current general Gemini models. High if routing to a specialized music API.
Long Context:
Gemini API: Handled by choosing a model that supports a large context window (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro could handle up to 1 million tokens). Your current gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 also has a decent context window.
Proxy: The client sends the large prompt; the proxy passes it to ai.models.generateContent().
Feasibility: High.
Structured Output (e.g., JSON):
Gemini API: Use generateContent with config: { responseMimeType: "application/json" } and instruct the model in the prompt to format its output as JSON.
Proxy: Client requests structured output; proxy adds the responseMimeType to the config.
Feasibility: High.
Thinking:
Gemini API: For gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17, this is controlled by the thinkingConfig in the config object for generateContent. You can enable (default) or disable it.
Proxy: Can pass the thinkingConfig from the client or set a default.
Feasibility: High.
Function Calling:
Gemini API: Define tools (which describe functions your application can execute) in the config for generateContent. The model may respond with a request to call one of your functions.
Proxy: The proxy needs to manage the tool definitions and the multi-turn conversation: client sends prompt -> proxy calls Gemini -> Gemini asks to call a function -> proxy returns this to client OR executes a server-side function -> client/proxy sends function result back to Gemini -> Gemini gives final answer.
Feasibility: Medium. It adds complexity to the proxy's logic and state management.
Document Understanding:
Gemini API: Send the document content (e.g., text extracted from a PDF, or image parts for image-based documents) as part of the contents in a generateContent call.
Proxy: Handles receiving document data (potentially large) from the client and formatting it for the API.
Feasibility: High.
Image Understanding:
Gemini API: Send image data (e.g., base64 string) along with a text prompt in contents to generateContent.
Proxy: Client uploads image; proxy forwards it.
Feasibility: High.
Video Understanding:
Gemini API: Some Gemini models support video as input. You'd provide video data (similar to image data, but potentially processed into frames or a specific format) in the contents.
Proxy: Handles video data upload and formatting.
Feasibility: Medium to High, depending on model support and data handling complexity.
Audio Understanding (Speech-to-Text):
Gemini API: Some models support audio input for transcription or other understanding tasks. The gemini-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-dialog model does this as part of its live session.
Proxy: For non-live audio, client uploads audio; proxy sends it to generateContent. For live audio, it's complex (see point below).
Feasibility: High for pre-recorded audio. Complex for live.
Code Execution:
Gemini API: Gemini can generate and explain code. It doesn't execute arbitrary code directly via the API for security. "Code execution" usually implies using Function Calling where one of your tools could be a sandboxed code interpreter.
Proxy: Can relay code generation requests. If using a tool for execution, see "Function Calling."
Feasibility: High for code generation. Medium for tool-based execution.
URL Context:
Gemini API: If the model supports it, you can include URLs in your prompt, and the model may be ableto fetch and use information from that URL.
Proxy: Passes the URL as part of the prompt.
Feasibility: Medium (depends on model's capability and reliability for this).
Grounding with Google Search:
Gemini API: Add tools: [{googleSearch: {}}] to the config for generateContent.
Proxy: Client requests search or AI decides to search; proxy ensures this tool is configured.
Feasibility: High.
Voice (Native Live Audio as in GdmLiveAudio.ts):
This remains the most challenging to proxy through a simple serverless function like api/gemini-proxy.ts. The createLiveSession from the SDK is stateful and uses a persistent connection.
Option 1 (Secure, Recommended for voice): Use browser-based SpeechRecognition (STT) to get text, send this text through your existing proxy's chat endpoint, get a text response, then use browser-based SpeechSynthesis (TTS) to speak it. This avoids the complexity of proxying the native live audio session and keeps your main API key secure.
Option 2 (Backend WebSocket): Set up a dedicated, persistent backend (not a simple serverless function) that can manage the WebSocket connection for createLiveSession.
Option 3 (Exposed Key for Voice - Risky): If you absolutely need GdmLiveAudio.ts as is, and you use Vite to build, VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY would be embedded in the client, exposing that key. This is generally not advised for your primary key.
In conclusion: Your api/gemini-proxy.ts can be extended to handle almost all these capabilities by adding new action types in its switch statement. For each action, it would prepare the specific payload for the Gemini SDK method (generateContent with various parts/configs, or generateImages). The main hurdles are true video/music generation from text (which likely need different APIs) and seamlessly proxying the native live audio dialog.
