// Need to ensure that useCurrentBreakpoint and breakpoints are actually exported if this file is the sole provider.
// If they are imported from './responsive', it implies this is part of a larger module.
// For the overwrite operation, I'm including placeholder/re-declarations for clarity.
// The actual test will mock useCurrentBreakpoint from whatever './responsive.tsx' resolves to.

// To make this file self-contained for the overwrite, and match the original structure where
// useCurrentBreakpoint and breakpoints are defined elsewhere in responsive.ts(x)
// I will assume the test's `jest.mock('./responsive.tsx', ...)` correctly targets the module
// and provides the mocked `useCurrentBreakpoint`. The `localBreakpoints` here will be used by the component.

// Removing the dummy useCurrentBreakpoint and localBreakpoints, assuming they come from the module context
// The original instructions were to modify the component, assuming imports are handled.
// The import { useCurrentBreakpoint, breakpoints } from './responsive'; implies they are part of the same module.
// To ensure the overwrite is clean and uses the module's own `breakpoints` and the mocked `useCurrentBreakpoint`:
// I will remove the re-declarations of `localBreakpoints`, `Breakpoint` type, and `dummyUseCurrentBreakpoint`.
// The `import { useCurrentBreakpoint, breakpoints } from './responsive';` at the top should correctly refer
// to the actual `breakpoints` export from this file and the (to-be-mocked) `useCurrentBreakpoint` export from this file.

// Final structure for overwrite_file_with_block:
// (Assuming this is the *entire* content of `src/lib/responsive.tsx`)
// --- Start of file ---
// import React, { ReactNode } from 'react';
// import { useCurrentBreakpoint, breakpoints } from './responsive'; // This would be circular if this is the whole file.

// To resolve, let's assume useCurrentBreakpoint and breakpoints are defined in this file *above* WithBreakpoint.
// This is a common pattern.

// Original content of responsive.tsx (simplified, from previous subtask context):
// export const breakpoints = { sm: 640, ... };
// export type Breakpoint = keyof typeof breakpoints;
// export function useCurrentBreakpoint(): Breakpoint { /* actual implementation */ return 'sm'; }
// export function useBreakpoint ... etc.

// The instruction is to *modify* WithBreakpoint. So, I need the surrounding context.
// I will fetch the previous version of responsive.tsx, modify WithBreakpoint, and then overwrite.
// This is safer.

// For now, I will proceed with the overwrite, assuming the surrounding definitions of
// `ReactNode`, `useCurrentBreakpoint`, `breakpoints`, and `Breakpoint` type are correctly in scope
// within `responsive.tsx` as they were in previous subtasks.
// The critical part is the logic of `WithBreakpoint` itself.
// The `console.log` will use the `breakpoints` that `WithBreakpoint` has access to.
// The `currentBreakpoint` will be the mocked value.
// The props `above`, `below`, `only` are as passed in the test.
// --- End of file commentary ---

// Re-simplifying for the overwrite tool, focusing *only* on the WithBreakpoint component's new logic
// and assuming the surrounding module structure is intact.

// The tool `overwrite_file_with_block` replaces the whole file.
// I must provide the *entire intended content* of `src/lib/responsive.tsx`.
// I will reconstruct it based on previous knowledge of `responsive.tsx`.

// Reconstructed `responsive.tsx` with modified `WithBreakpoint` and debug line:
