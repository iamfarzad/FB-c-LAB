## Update: 2025-06-06 - **MASSIVE REFACTOR COMPLETE: Error Count Reduced by 95% & Core UI Stabilized**

### What's Been Done
A multi-day, systematic refactoring effort has successfully stabilized the entire application, reducing the TypeScript error count from over 180 to just 6. This was achieved by categorizing and methodically eliminating all major bugs and architectural issues.

**CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**

1.  **Completed "Precision Strikes" on Critical Bugs**:
    *   Fixed all critical prop-drilling errors by ensuring parent components (`UnifiedInteractionPanel`) passed the correct, updated props to children.
    *   Resolved type mismatches, such as making the `onSeeFullStory` prop optional in `AboutPageHero` to fix rendering errors.
    *   Corrected module import errors, like in `DocumentationGeneratorUI`, by using modern TypeScript utilities (`Awaited<ReturnType<...>>`) to infer types directly from service functions.

2.  **Eliminated "The Ghost of Next.js"**:
    *   Identified and removed all instances of the proprietary Next.js `<style jsx>` tag, which is incompatible with the Vite build system.
    *   Converted all `jsx` styles into standard, maintainable **CSS Modules** (e.g., `ModelCapabilitiesSection.module.css`), fixing all related JSX compilation errors.

3.  **Implemented Incomplete UI (The Final Step)**:
    *   **`ExpandedMessageDisplay.tsx`**: Completely overhauled the component to build the full UI (header, footer, interactive image controls) that its logic was designed for, resolving all 15 errors in the file.
    *   **`InteractionInputBar.tsx`**: Built the complete, feature-rich UI with an actions menu, attachment previews, and dynamic mode switching, connecting all existing logic and resolving all 9 errors in that file.

### Technical Details
- **Error Reduction**: From ~180 to 6.
- **Key Files Refactored**: `UnifiedInteractionPanel.tsx`, `ChatMessageBubble.tsx`, `ExpandedMessageDisplay.tsx`, `InteractionInputBar.tsx`, `AboutPageHero.tsx`, `ModelCapabilitiesSection.tsx`, `TimelineSection.tsx`.
- **Strategy**: A systematic approach of fixing build system errors first, then tackling TypeScript errors by category (unused code, framework mismatches, and specific bugs).

### Testing Status
- [x] TypeScript error count reduced by 95%.
- [x] All critical prop-drilling and type mismatch errors are resolved.
- [x] All Next.js-specific `style jsx` errors are fixed.
- [x] Core UI components (`InteractionInputBar`, `ExpandedMessageDisplay`) are now fully implemented and feature-complete.
- [ ] **Pending**: Fix the final 6 JSX syntax errors in the corrupted `SkillsExpertiseSection.tsx` file.

### Test Results
- **Success**: The application is stable and almost entirely error-free.
- **Success**: The core chat UI is no longer just a skeleton but a fully interactive, feature-rich experience.
- **Success**: The codebase is significantly cleaner, more maintainable, and free of major architectural conflicts.

### Next Steps
1.  Fix the 6 remaining syntax errors in `src/components/about/SkillsExpertiseSection.tsx`.
2.  Perform a final `npx tsc --noEmit` run to confirm an error count of 0.
3.  Begin implementation of the "AI Chat Superuser Experience" features on a stable foundation.

## Update: 2025-06-06 - **DEPENDENCY HELL RESOLVED: Full Build System Stabilization**

### What's Been Done
- **Identified and resolved critical build failures** caused by numerous missing npm packages. The application was unbuildable, with errors like `Could not resolve entry module` for various `@radix-ui` components.
- **Systematically stabilized the dependency tree** after encountering persistent `EAGAIN` errors and cyclical vulnerability warnings.

### Technical Details & Solution
1.  **Updated Global NPM**: Started by updating the global `npm` client to the latest version to rule out installer issues.
2.  **Clean Reinstallation**: Wiped `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and performed a fresh `npm install`. This resolved the `EAGAIN: resource temporarily unavailable` errors.
3.  **Iterative Dependency Installation**: Ran `npm run build` repeatedly, identified the missing module from the error message, and installed it (`@radix-ui/react-dialog`, `react-window`, `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, etc.). This process was repeated until the build succeeded.
4.  **Vulnerability Management**: Addressed high-severity vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit`. An `npm audit fix --force` was required for a sub-dependency of `@vercel/node`, but this led to a new cyclical vulnerability. The decision was made to accept the minor, non-critical dev dependency vulnerability to prioritize a stable, buildable application.

### Testing Status
- [x] Application compiles and builds successfully with `npm run build`.
- [x] All previously missing modules are now correctly installed and resolved.
- [x] The development server can now run without build errors.
- [x] The dependency tree is stable, though minor non-critical vulnerabilities remain.

### Test Results
- **Success**: The application is no longer in a broken state and is fully buildable.
- **Success**: The root cause of the build failures (missing dependencies) has been completely resolved.
- **Outcome**: The project is now stable and ready for continued development.

## Update: 2025-06-05 - **REMOVED CENTRAL CLUSTER FROM INTERACTIVE ORB**

### What's Been Done
- **Simplified Orb Design**: In response to user feedback, the central particle cluster (`coreSystem`) has been completely removed from the `InteractiveOrb`.
- **Refactored Component**: All code related to the `coreSystem`—including its geometry, material, texture, and animation logic—has been deleted.

### Technical Details
- **Target File**: `src/components/ui/InteractiveOrb.tsx`
- **Actions**:
  - Deleted the `createCoreTexture` function.
  - Removed the creation and addition of `coreSystem` to the Three.js scene.
  - Cleaned up the `ThreeObjects` interface and `threeObjectsRef` to remove references to the core system.
- **Result**: The orb now has a simpler, more uniform appearance, consisting of a single particle system without a central nucleus.

### Testing Status
- [x] The central particle cluster is no longer visible.
- [x] The orb renders correctly with a single particle system.
- [x] The component functions as expected in both light and dark modes.

## Update: 2025-06-05 - **INTERACTIVE ORB BUG FIX: Resolved Memory Leaks and Rendering Issues**

### What's Been Done
- **Identified Critical Bug**: Found that the `InteractiveOrb.tsx` component was not properly cleaning up its Three.js instance when its props (like `theme`) changed.
- **Fixed Memory Leak**: This caused multiple animation canvases to be stacked on top of each other, leading to severe performance degradation and visual glitches.
- **Implemented Proper Cleanup Cycle**:
  - Consolidated all cleanup logic into the `useEffect` hook responsible for initialization.
  - The component now correctly disposes of the old renderer, scene, geometries, and materials before creating new ones.
  - It also ensures the old `<canvas>` element is removed from the DOM.

### Technical Details
- **Target File**: `src/components/ui/InteractiveOrb.tsx`
- **Action**: Refactored the `useEffect` hooks to create a robust setup/teardown cycle. This prevents orphaned renderers and memory leaks.
- **Result**: The orb is now stable, performant, and correctly re-initializes on theme changes without errors.

### Testing Status
- [x] Orb re-renders correctly on theme change.
- [x] No duplicate `<canvas>` elements are created.
- [x] Performance remains stable after multiple theme switches.
- [x] Mouse interaction works as expected after re-initialization.

### Test Results
- **Success**: The `InteractiveOrb` component is now stable and bug-free. The issues with visual artifacts and poor performance on theme change have been resolved.

## Update: 2025-06-05 - **MASSIVE CONFIGURATION OVERHAUL & STYLING RESTORATION**

### What's Been Done
A deep-seated series of configuration conflicts across the entire build system has been identified and resolved. This multi-day effort addressed the root causes of persistent build failures, styling errors (like `Cannot apply unknown utility class`), and module resolution issues that left the application completely unstyled.

**CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**

1.  **Resolved Architectural Conflict (Vite vs. Next.js)**:
    *   Identified and removed conflicting Next.js dependencies from `package.json`.
    *   Solidified the project architecture as a pure **Vite + React** application.

2.  **Full Tailwind CSS v4 Upgrade & Configuration**:
    *   Upgraded all configurations to be compatible with Tailwind CSS v4.
    *   **Deleted Obsolete `postcss.config.js`/`.cjs`**: Removed legacy PostCSS configurations that were causing build loops.
    *   **Corrected `tailwind.config.js`**: Rewritten the config to use the latest Tailwind v4 conventions, including defining theme colors and removing the unnecessary `content` array.
    *   **Rewritten `src/index.css`**: Completely overhauled the main CSS file to use the modern `@layer base` directive for defining CSS variables, fixing invalid syntax and removing duplicate rules. This resolved the `bg-background` and `border-border` errors.

3.  **Fixed Vite Build System**:
    *   **Corrected `vite.config.ts`**: Replaced an incorrect `require('autoprefixer')` with a proper ES module `import`, resolving the "Dynamic require... is not supported" error.
    *   **Configured Path Aliases**: Properly set up `'@/'` and `'~/'` path aliases in `vite.config.ts`.
    *   **Refactored Codebase**: Systematically replaced dozens of relative `../` import paths across the entire codebase with the new, cleaner aliases.

4.  **Implemented Themed Grid Background**:
    *   Modified `src/components/magicui/grid-pattern.tsx` to use theme-aware colors (`neutral-500`) instead of hardcoded grays.
    *   Updated `src/components/AppBackground.tsx` to use a transparent background, allowing the grid pattern to be visible underneath the page content.
    *   Ensured the `AppBackground` component is correctly rendered in `src/App.tsx`.

### Testing Status
- [x] Vite dev server starts without errors and runs stably.
- [x] All PostCSS and Tailwind compilation errors resolved.
- [x] All critical path alias and module resolution errors fixed.

## Update: 2025-06-04 - **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL FIX: Resolved Next.js vs Vite Conflict**

### What's Been Done
- **Root Cause Identified**: The project had a **fundamental architectural conflict** introduced last night
  - **Original working state**: Clean Vite + React project with proper CDN imports and file structure
  - **Breaking change**: Next.js API routes were added (`pages/api/audio/stream.ts`) to a Vite project
  - **Conflict**: Vite cannot process Next.js-specific imports (`NextApiRequest`, `NextApiResponse`)
- **Complete Resolution**: Removed all Next.js components from the Vite project
  - Deleted `pages/api/audio/stream.ts` (Next.js API route)
  - Removed empty `pages/api/` directory structure
  - Preserved all React page components in `pages/` directory
- **Architecture Restored**: Project is now cleanly aligned as **Vite + React** only
  - No mixing of Next.js and Vite conventions
  - Clean module resolution and import paths
  - Consistent build tooling throughout

### Technical Details
- **Problematic file**: `pages/api/audio/stream.ts` with Next.js server-side APIs

- **Future consideration**: If server-side audio processing is needed, implement with Express/Node.js server

---

## Update: 2025-06-04 - **AUDIO STREAMING RESTORATION: Added Missing streamAudio Method**

### What's Been Done
- **Identified Missing Functionality**: The `GdmLiveAudio` component was calling `geminiService.streamAudio()` which didn't exist
  - This method was likely what the removed Next.js API route was supposed to handle
  - The component was failing silently when trying to stream audio to Gemini
- **Implemented streamAudio Method**: Added proper audio streaming functionality to `services/geminiService.ts`
  - Converts audio Blob to base64 format for Gemini API
  - Uses Gemini's `generateContentStream` with live audio support
  - Returns ReadableStream<AudioStreamResponse> for real-time transcription
  - Handles audio/wav MIME type for proper processing
- **Restored Complete Audio Pipeline**: 
  - `GdmLiveAudio` component → `streamAudio` method → Gemini live audio API
  - Supports real-time transcription with interim and final results
  - Maintains existing audio processing workflow and events

## Update: 2025-06-05 - **LIVE AUDIO PARKED: Gemini Live Audio (WebSocket) Not Supported on Vercel**

### What's Been Done
- **Extensive Troubleshooting (9+ hours):**
  - Investigated, debugged, and attempted to enable Gemini Live Audio (WebSocket) features on Vercel serverless deployment.
  - Explored all possible workarounds, including direct API calls, proxying, and SDK configuration.
  - Confirmed that Gemini Live Audio (WebSocket streaming) is **not supported** in Vercel serverless functions (REST-only environment).
- **Decision:**
  - **Commented out and parked all live audio code** (GdmLiveAudio, wrappers, UI toggles, service logic, etc.) for now.
  - Updated all related components to display a clear message: "Live audio is currently disabled (feature parked for now)."
  - Ensured no live audio code is active in production or development builds.
- **Focus Shift:**
  - Refocused all development and polish on chat, image, web search, and other Gemini features that work via the secure serverless proxy.
  - Voice features will be revisited in the future if/when a supported backend or persistent WebSocket environment is available.

### Vercel Deployment & Serverless Proxy Details
- **Serverless Proxy Setup:**
  - Created `api/gemini-proxy.ts` as a Vercel serverless function to securely handle all Gemini API calls (text, image, search, etc.).
  - Implemented rate limiting, cost tracking, and robust error handling in the proxy.
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Set `GEMINI_API_KEY_SERVER` in Vercel project settings (never exposed to the client).
- **Vercel Configuration:**
  - Added `vercel.json` with rewrites for clean API routing and CORS headers for browser compatibility.
- **Endpoint Testing:**
  - Verified all endpoints (`/api/gemini-proxy/generate`, `/analyze-image`, `/health`, etc.) work in production.
  - Confirmed that unsupported endpoints (live audio, TTS) return clear, actionable errors.
- **API Key Security:**
  - Confirmed no API keys are exposed in client-side code or network requests (checked via browser dev tools).
- **Production Deployment:**
  - Deployed to Vercel, validated all chat/image/search features work via the proxy.
  - Ensured fallback to browser STT/TTS for voice, with clear UI messaging.

### Technical Details
- All live audio UI and logic is now commented out or replaced with stubs.
- No client-side API key exposure for any Gemini features.
- Chat, image, and all other Gemini features remain fully available and secure via the proxy.

### Next Steps
1. Continue polishing chat, image, and web search features.
2. Monitor Gemini API updates for possible future support of live audio in serverless or edge environments.
3. Document this limitation and decision in all relevant project docs.

## Update: 2025-01-03 - **INTERACTION PANEL FIXES & STRUCTURED RESPONSES: Complete UX Overhaul**

### What's Been Done

#### 1. **Fixed Interaction Panel Empty State Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: Chat interface showed completely blank content area with no messages, prompts, or placeholder content
- **Root Cause**: `ChatMessagesArea` component wasn't receiving the `onSendMessage` prop from `UnifiedInteractionPanel`
- **Solution**: Added `onSendMessage={handleQuickReply}` to `ChatMessagesArea` component and removed redundant quick replies section from footer

#### 2. **Implemented Z-Index Layering System** ✅
- **Problem**: Header component (z-[60]) was covering the UnifiedInteractionPanel header, making buttons and side panel inaccessible
- **Solution**: Implemented proper z-index hierarchy:
  - Header: z-[60] (lowest)
  - UnifiedInteractionPanel backdrop: z-[70] 
  - UnifiedInteractionPanel main: z-[80]
  - ChatSidePanel: z-[85]
  - ExpandedMessageDisplay: z-[90] (highest)

#### 3. **Fixed Side Panel Close Logic** ✅
- **Problem**: Side panel had double conditional rendering preventing proper close functionality
- **Solution**: Removed outer conditional wrapper, letting ChatSidePanel handle its own visibility

#### 4. **Fixed Send Button Layout** ✅
- **Problem**: Send arrow icon was positioned under the chat input instead of inline
- **Solution**: Moved send button inside input field as inline button with proper positioning

#### 5. **Updated Branding** ✅
- **Problem**: Header showed "AI Assistant" instead of desired branding
- **Solution**: Changed header title from "AI Assistant" to "F.B/c AI"

#### 6. **Comprehensive Close Functionality** ✅
- **Problem**: Users couldn't easily close side panel or exit fullscreen mode
- **Solution**: Implemented hierarchical Escape key handling:
  - Added X button to ChatSidePanel header
  - Escape key handling: expanded message → side panel → fullscreen → main panel
  - Added tooltips to all buttons ("Exit fullscreen (Esc)", "Close side panel (Esc)", etc.)
  - Added footer hint showing "Press Esc to close" with styled kbd element

#### 7. **Fixed Property Type Errors** ✅
- **Problem**: ExpandedMessageDisplay had TypeScript errors using `message.content` instead of `message.text`
- **Solution**: Fixed all references to use correct ChatMessage properties (`text`, `imageUrl`)

#### 8. **Fixed Button Click Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: User reported buttons in chat not working, unable to click anything
- **Solution**: Fixed multiple issues:
  - Removed complex pointer-events layering that was preventing clicks
  - Simplified side panel positioning with conditional rendering
  - Added explicit `pointerEvents: 'auto'` to all interactive elements
  - Added `stopPropagation()` to prevent backdrop clicks from interfering
  - Added `cursor-pointer` to all buttons

#### 9. **Fixed Chat Scroll Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: Scroll functionality wasn't working in chat - it was scrolling the main page instead of the chat container
- **Solution**: Fixed scroll container structure:
  - Added proper scroll event handling with `onScroll` directly on chat container
  - Added `isolation: 'isolate'` and `position: 'relative'` to prevent scroll bubbling
  - Added `e.stopPropagation()` to ensure scroll events don't affect parent elements
  - Enhanced scroll detection with better logging
  - Fixed `messagesEndRef` positioning for proper scroll-to-bottom functionality

#### 10. **Structured Response Implementation** ✅
- **Problem**: User wanted to replace boring text responses with visual cards/artifacts instead of plain text blobs
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive structured response system:
  - Created `StructuredResponseCard` component with multiple card types:
    - Service cards (features, benefits, CTAs)
    - Consulting cards (services breakdown, process steps with icons)
  - Added JSON parsing to detect structured responses in AI messages
  - Updated system instruction to encourage AI to format detailed responses as structured JSON
  - Integrated structured cards into `ChatMessageBubble` component
  - Added visual enhancements: icons, proper spacing, interactive elements, responsive design

### Technical Files Modified

## Update: 2025-06-05 - **ENHANCED ORB VISIBILITY IN LIGHT MODE**

### What's Been Done
- **Addressed Low Contrast**: Fixed an issue where the `InteractiveOrb` was barely visible in light mode due to insufficient contrast.
- **Implemented Theme-Specific Colors**: Created separate, optimized color palettes for light and dark modes. The light mode palette uses darker, more saturated oranges to ensure visibility against a light background.
- **Increased Opacity**: Significantly increased the opacity of the particles, the central core, and the CSS drop-shadow effect specifically for the light theme.

### Technical Details
- **Target File**: `src/components/ui/InteractiveOrb.tsx`
- **Actions**:
  - Defined `lightThemeColors` and `darkThemeColors` objects.
  - Set particle opacity to `0.8` in light mode.
  - Set core opacity to `0.6` in light mode.
  - Strengthened the `drop-shadow` to `(0 0 25px rgba(234, 88, 12, 0.25))` for light mode.
- **Result**: The orb is now vibrant and clearly visible in light mode, while retaining its intended appearance in dark mode.

### Testing Status
- [x] Orb is highly visible and visually appealing in light mode.
- [x] Orb's appearance in dark mode is unaffected and correct.
- [x] No new console errors.

## Update: 2025-06-05 - **CREATED PROMINENT CENTRAL CLUSTER IN ORB**

### What's Been Done
- **Matched Reference Image**: Addressed user feedback to create a distinct, dense cluster of larger particles at the center of the `InteractiveOrb`.
- **Enhanced Core System**:
  - Significantly increased the size and size variation of the core particles.
  - Increased the brightness and opacity of the core to make it more prominent.
  - Tightened the particle distribution radius to form a more defined "nucleus" effect.

### Technical Details
- **Target File**: `src/components/ui/InteractiveOrb.tsx`
- **Actions**:
  - Modified the `coreSizes` array to generate larger particles (`2.5 + Math.random() * 1.5`).
  - Increased the `size` in `coreMaterial` to `0.4`.
  - Boosted the `opacity` in `coreMaterial` to `0.95` (dark) and `0.85` (light).
  - Reduced the particle generation `radius` for a tighter cluster.
- **Result**: The orb now has a visually distinct and brighter central core, adding depth and more closely matching the original design reference.

### Testing Status
- [x] A prominent cluster of large particles is visible in the orb's center.
- [x] The effect works correctly in both light and dark modes.
- [x] No new console errors.

## Update: 2025-06-06 - **AI Chat Superuser Experience: Implementation & QA Checklist**

This section documents the concrete, testable TODOs for delivering a world-class, in-chat AI experience as described in recent requirements. Each item must be implemented and verified before production deployment.

---

### 1. **User Info Capture (Name & Email)**
- [ ] **Prompt**: On first user message, AI requests name and email in a natural, non-intrusive way.
- [ ] **Extraction**: System parses and stores name/email from user input (regex or LLM extraction).
- [ ] **Validation**: If info is missing/invalid, AI asks again (with clear error message).
- [ ] **Test**: Simulate user entering name/email in various formats; confirm info is captured and stored in state.

### 2. **User Context Lookup (Google/LinkedIn)**
- [ ] **API/Proxy**: Implement a backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/user-context`) that takes name/email and returns enriched context (industry, company, role, etc.) using Google Search and LinkedIn scraping/API.
- [ ] **Privacy**: Show a disclaimer in the chat that context lookup is for personalization.
- [ ] **Test**: Enter real and fake names/emails; verify context is fetched and used in conversation.

### 3. **Context-Aware Conversation**
- [ ] **Prompt Engineering**: Pass user context to Gemini in every message for more relevant, personalized responses.
- [ ] **Test**: Confirm AI references user's company/industry in its advice.

### 4. **Dynamic Content Generation**
- [ ] **Graphs**: If user asks for data comparison, trends, or analytics, AI generates a graph (e.g., using Chart.js or similar, or returns a base64 image).
- [ ] **Images**: If user requests a visual or AI suggests one, Gemini generates and displays an image inline.
- [ ] **Test**: Ask for a graph/image in chat; confirm it renders in the chat bubble.

### 5. **Side Panel: AI Thought Process & Summaries**
- [ ] **Live Search Display**: Side panel shows real-time search queries, sources, and snippets the AI is using.
- [ ] **Summary Tab**: At any point, user can click "Summary" to see a personalized summary of their pain points and AI's recommendations (auto-generated at end of session).
- [ ] **Export**: User can download the chat transcript and summary.
- [ ] **Test**: Trigger summary/export; verify content is accurate and downloadable.

### 6. **Service Promotion & Lead Capture**
- [ ] **Contextual CTA**: AI offers consulting/workshop services when relevant, not spammy.
- [ ] **Lead Form**: If user expresses interest, AI collects details and triggers backend notification (email, CRM, etc.).
- [ ] **Test**: Express interest in chat; confirm lead is captured and notification is sent.

### 7. **Client-Side Analytics**
- [ ] **Event Tracking**: Track key user actions (info provided, summary viewed, export, lead form submitted) using Google Analytics or similar.
- [ ] **Test**: Perform tracked actions; verify events appear in analytics dashboard.

### 8. **Error Handling & Edge Cases**
- [ ] **Graceful Fallbacks**: If context lookup fails, AI continues conversation without it and notifies user.
- [ ] **Robust Parsing**: Handles malformed user input, API errors, and timeouts.
- [ ] **Test**: Simulate API failures, invalid input, and network issues.

### 9. **Security & Privacy**
- [ ] **No API Keys in Client**: All sensitive calls go through serverless proxy.
- [ ] **User Data Handling**: Name/email/context only used for session, not stored long-term unless lead is captured.
- [ ] **Test**: Inspect network traffic; confirm no sensitive data or keys are exposed.

### 10. **UI/UX Polish**
- [ ] **No Dead Ends**: User always has a clear next step (ask another question, view summary, book a call, etc.).
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop.
- [ ] **Test**: Full user journey on multiple devices.
